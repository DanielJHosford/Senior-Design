# Project Abstract
Our project focus is to help enhance a companyâ€™s systems that are currently in place. The current systems that we use to do accounting, document management, and communicating we believe can be improved through software enhancements. We will gain experience using Docusign, QuickBooks, python, and excel. We will work to improve speed of communication with customers signing contracts. We will go through requirements gathering, project planning, development, testing and implementation of the improvements throughout the two semesters. We will automate some reports that we are currently manually generating through QuickBooks. We are planning on implementing an Agile workflow for the semester to accomplish all the enhancements throughout the project.
 # Current Solutions
Currently we have a very time intensive and slow response system in order to ensure that all company needs are met. This system involves three individuals and a lot of communication. As a company it will enhance our image and decrease our processing costs if we can improve to new systems. 
 # Technical Background
**Background Skills:** We have expierence using sql, python, c++, as well as familiarity with current systems of quickbooks and docusign. 
**Interests:** We are interested in combining these coding skills with the tools of the current system in order to create a more seamless system. 
# Project Team Approach
Our approach is to research into the existing tools and others on the internet that will best serve the needs of the company. From this research we will then start to implement those solutions. We will build a database on postgreSQL to store the data and integrate into the data to other systems. We have been using a agile team method of making progress and communicating throughout the project term.

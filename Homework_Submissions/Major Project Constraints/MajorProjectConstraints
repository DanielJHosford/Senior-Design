# Economic Cost
Economic Cost is one constraint that we will have to be aware of as this solution will have ongoing License Fees in a low budget environment. Most likely to implement this at the end of our project whatever software/tools we use will have to have minimal licensing fees for the company to keep using. As the company would only get a limited amount of financial benefit, it is important to keep in a low budget environment. 
# Time
Time is another constraint that will be crucial to meet the yearlong assignment and to be used by the company. We will have to be very critical of time to complete the project before the school year is out to present our project effectively. We also need to ensure that the improvements are done as soon as possible so the company can start using it in a timely manner. 
# Scope 
Scope is a crucial constraint because it affects all the other constraints that affect the project. The bigger the scope the more expensive our project will be. Because of this we must target specific time savers that will help the company economically. Another constraint it affects is time. We must be able to complete all the tasks by the end of the year, so it is important we keep it at a manageable amount. 
# Security 
Security is a top constraint for our project because we will be dealing with Real User information when the project is implemented. Because it will have personal information such as address and contact information, we need to be careful of who can access it. We will need to limit the ability of seeing the information to the proper individuals.
